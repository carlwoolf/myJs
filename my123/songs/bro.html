W:
W: Ancient Greek apparently was written 'scriptio continu', that is with no
W: spaces between the words. Our Torahs do put spaces between words. But if
W: they did not, the first three words of Genesis could be parsed in a
W: mystical vein as: ברא שיתברא אלהים. Let's say we follow the traditional
W: reading of Elohim in the singular, while pointing the first word as
W:imperative: B'ro/create. This leads to a reading like: Create/manifest!
W:So that Divinity shall/can thus create/manifest Itself. Taking the word Et in one of
W:its standard though less common senses, the rest of Genesis 1:1 would
W:continue: '... together with Heaven and Earth', which nowadays suggests
W: the Divine holiness of eco-systems large and small, that is, holiness of 'everything'.
W: And then, connecting to verse 4: Everyone, every thing, can 'see the light',
W: can participate in, can nourish, the manifestation of Divinity in all things.
